    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Hi there! I'm glad you came here, to learn about a part of my existence.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">These {{ books }} books from {{ authors }} authors, among {{ genres }}
        genres, are present here for a self-retrospective purpose of what literatures made part of my life. Each one of
        these books brought something unique and priceless to me, being it a curious situation, train of thought or just
        an interesting story that could happen to anyone. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Some of them, revealed aspects of human nature that I wouldn't have the chance to know
        by my sole experience, with acts, thoughts, behaviours that could make us feel
        so proud of our existence, and some of them, revealing disappointing aspects of our nature. For the bad or for
        the good, they helped me to build some parts of my character, and I'm thankful for the efforts invested by so
        many intelligent and brilliant authors throughout the history.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">A book, is a silent friend that is always there, whenever you need it, waiting to tell you something,
        waiting to take you into a journey, without taking you out of home. How great is that, isn't it?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Or as Carl Sagan once said:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;"><i>"What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a
        tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're
        inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author
        is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human
        inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the
        shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic."</i></p><br>
