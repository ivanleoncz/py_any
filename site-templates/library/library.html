    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Personally, I think that a book, is a silent friend, that is always there, whenever you
        need it, waiting to tell you something, maybe taking you into a journey, while sitting on your sofa.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Carl Sagan once said:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;"><i>"What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a
        tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're
        inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author
        is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human
        inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the
        shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic."</i></p><br>
