    <h2>Hello!</h2><br>
    <p>This is catalog of books that I read. More than a humble catalog of just {{ books }} books
        from {{ authors }} authors, among {{ genres }} genres, it's a retrospective of what literatures
        have made part of my life and that are part of my small library. Each book brought something priceless,
        being it a curious situation or a train of thought that sparked some insights to me, in terms of a variety
        of topics in life.</p>
    <p>Some of them revealed aspects of human nature that I wouldn't have the chance to know by my sole
        experience (I guess), with acts, thoughts, behaviours that could make us so proud and happy
        with our existence on this planet, but also so shameful and disappointed with ourselves. </p>
    <p>May this humble website be also a way of presenting interesting authors to whom I hold great admiration
        and their books that are true gifts to humanity, before, now and ever, with all my gratitude for the rich
        inheritance that they represent to us all.</p>
