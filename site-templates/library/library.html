    <p style="font-size: 16px;">I didn't read so many books so far. The few that I remember, I listed here.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">{{ books }} books from {{ authors }} authors, among {{ genres }} genres: it's a retrospective
        of what kind of literatures participated in my life. Each book gave something unique/priceless to me, a curious
        story, a train of thought. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Some of them, revealed aspects of human nature that I wouldn't have the chance to know
        by my sole experience, with acts, thoughts, behaviours that could make you feel so proud of the human existence,
        some revealing disappointing aspects of our nature. For the bad or for the good, they helped to shape my
        character, and at least, I can say that I'm thankful for the efforts invested by these intelligent and brilliant
        authors throughout the history.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Personally, I think that a book is a silent friend that is always there, whenever you
        need it, waiting to tell you something, waiting to take you into a journey, without taking you out of home.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">How great is that, isn't it? Or as Carl Sagan once said:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;"><i>"What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a
        tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're
        inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author
        is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human
        inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the
        shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic."</i></p><br>
